## Welcome to Sinara

Sinara is an open-source hardware ecosystem originally designed for use in quantum physics experiments running the [ARTIQ](https://m-labs.hk/artiq/) control software.  The hardware is also suitable for a broad range of laboratory and test & measurement applications.

It is licensed under CERN OHL v1.2.

## Why Sinara?

Control electronics used in many trapped-ion and other quantum physics experiments suffers from a number of problems. In general, an ad-hoc solution is hastily put together in-house without enough consideration about good design, reproducibility, testing and documentation. This makes those systems unreliable, fragile, and difficult to use and maintain. It also duplicates work in different laboratories. In addition, the performance and features of the existing systems (e.g. regarding pulse shaping abilities) is becoming insufficient for some experiments.

To alleviate those problems, Sinara aims to be:

- high-quality
- simple to use and "turn-key"
- reproducible and open
- flexible and modular
- well tested
- well supported by the ARTIQ control software

## Who develops Sinara

Sinara is currently developed by a collaboration including M-Labs, Warsaw University of Technology (WUT), US Army Research Laboratory (ARL), the University of Oxford, the University of Maryland and NIST. The majority of the hardware is designed by WUT. The work is funded by ARL, Duke University, the University of Oxford, and the University of Freiburg.


## Getting Started

The [main project wiki](https://github.com/sinara-hw/meta/wiki) is the best place to start.

Each piece of hardware has its own repository in the main [sinara-hw GitHub organization](https://github.com/sinara-hw).  The wiki and issue tracker of each repository are used for documentation.  Output files such as pdf schematics can be found in the releases.
